This package was obtained in October 2020 from:
http://www.thaoh.net/BallDroppings/#

It was derived from an earlier, non-color version by Josh Nimoy,
https://github.com/jtnimoy/BallDroppings

Notes about the Thaoh version:

This version works on all three browsers (Pale Moon, Firefox, Chrome),
but on the latter two, if I turn on sound, the program hangs.

On my saved copy, with *any* of the browsers, 
if I turn on sound, the program hangs.
